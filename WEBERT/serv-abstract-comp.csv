14,None,9612190,"PROJECT SUMMARY N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) and has been implicated in many cellular processes, including splicing, mRNA stability, translational activity, and cytoplasmic localization. Moreover, deficits in m6A methylation are linked to human diseases, such as obesity, developmental deficits, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Studies in our laboratory and others indicate that m6A can influence cellular processes by directly recruiting ?reader? proteins or by regulating the accessibility of RNA-binding proteins through alteration of local RNA structure (called the m6A-switch). However, despite the rapidly growing interest in and importance of m6A, the methods available for mapping m6A have considerable drawbacks, including the requirement of large amounts of sample input and the inability to determine the modification stoichiometry, a known variable of the m6A epitranscriptome. The proposed research aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel deaminase-based m6A-seq method (Deam-seq) that will allow for determination of the m6A modification fraction at single-base resolution. Moreover, since this approach requires no enrichment step and is enzyme-based, it should be readily applicable for characterization of biologically limited samples, such as clinical specimens. If successful, we anticipate that this new technology will be extremely powerful in monitoring epitranscriptional dynamics and characterizing unique cell types within a population. Moreover, I will also test the hypothesis that the methylation fraction plays an important role in regulating mRNA splicing. Finally, given the emerging evidence that intronic m6A residues may be far more common than suggested based on conventional m6A-seq approaches, I will also develop new methodology for global determination of the m6A landscape within introns and nuclear circular RNAs. Overall, this research should yield many new insights into how m6A modulates mRNA fate.",Cell and Tissue Culture,-3.7040321666990437

5,None,9483739,"Atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, and Project Leaders of our PPG have contributed seminal information to the widespread recognition that immune mechanisms play a central role in modulating atherogenesis. Leveraging information gained in the first cycle, we propose studies of the roles of macrophages, T cells, B cells, Natural antibodies (NAbs) and innate TLRs on inflammation and atherogenesis. Project 1 will pursue their seminal observations that foam cell formation in the peritoneum of cholesterol-fed mice exhibited an unexpected suppressed inflammatory gene phenotype, which was due to accumulation of desmosterol, a potent LXR ligand, leading to inhibition of inflammatory gene expression. They will study the transcriptional mechanisms by which this occurs, and determine if novel therapeutic approaches can be exploited based on use of desmosterol-like agents that inhibit inflammatory activity. Project 2 will pursue their findings that PPARy is expressed in Treg  cells in peri-aortic adipose tissue, which surrounds the aorta at key anatomical sites where atherogenesis is enhanced. They will explore the hypothesis that this is mediated by a proinflammatory gene network that can be modulated at the transcriptional level by PPARy and REVERBa/p, regulating vital functions of Treg and Th17 cells. Project 3 will pursue their recent identification that oxidation specific epitopes (OSE), as occur on OxLDL or apoptotic cells, are major targets of innate NAbs. They will focus on defining the prevalence of OSE-NAbs in humans and mice, the mechanisms by which they are atheroprotective, and define transcriptional mechanisms by which GR and LXR regulate B-1 cells, which generate NAbs. Overall, these studies should provide vital insights into novel and as yet unexplored mechanisms by which adaptive and innate immunity regulates inflammation and atherosclerosis, and may lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular disease.",Cell and Tissue Culture,-6.322185960149312

DESCRIPTION: The main aims of this multiple-PI proposal are: to continue to define the underlying mechanisms of improved hepatocyte transduction by our next generation of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors; to extend these studies to novel AAV2 variants with high liver tropism, enriched from a library, and to AAV3-based vectors, which show high efficacy in human hepatocytes and non-human primate liver; and to evaluate the efficacy and host immune response in gene therapy for hemophilia B. Candidate vectors for clinical trial with high efficacy in small and large animal models will be identified, with particular emphasis on in vivo gene transfer to human/primate hepatocytes and immunobiology. The current application encompassing an interdisciplinary approach should allow us to develop superior next generation vectors for liver-directed human gene therapy, drawing heavily from expertise at the University of Florida in AAV vector biology, immunology of AAV gene transfer, and animal model studies. We will test the following hypotheses: a. Minor changes in the capsid sequence can substantially improve liver gene transfer, in part through postentry mechanisms, allowing us to design superior AAV2- and AAV3-based vectors. b. A combination of molecular evolution and capsid engineering will result in vectors with high transduction efficiency of human/primate hepatocytes and reduced MHC I antigen presentation. c. Capsid-modified AAV vectors will provide therapeutic F.IX expression at low vector doses and with reduced immunogenicity.  The following three Specific Aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1: Further optimize and compare in vivo performance of novel AAV2- and AAV3-based vectors, and define the mechanisms responsible for the robust liver gene transfer. Specific Aim 2: Identify novel capsid variants for high-efficiency in vivo gene transfer to human hepatocytes and adopt these into an advanced baculovirus production system. Specific Aim 3: Test improved vectors in animal models of hemophilia and in non-human primates, and define their immunogenicity.

2,None,9481301,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Unravelling the genetic basis of human health and disease requires high-quality genome information. Heretofore, the community has relied on a single, haploid human reference sequence that does not represent the actual genome sequence of any single person. While this resource has been enormously beneficial for mapping many of the genetic variants responsible for human normal and disease variation, it can limit many types of analyses. Further, this single-reference model can cause uneven power to analyze genetic variation across all human populations.  Similarly, non-human primate genomes are also fundamentally important for understanding our own genome. While many draft primate genome assemblies are available, including for all great apes, these genomes are all of lower quality and contiguity than the human reference genome. Importantly, chromosome-scale scaffolding of these genomes was often done by comparison to the human reference. While this approximation is generally correct, knowing where this is wrong is critically important.  Using a radically innovative and simple approach, we can now generate highly contiguous de novo assemblies of human and non-human primate genomes. The approach requires sub- microgram quantities of DNA and can be carried done from start to finish within a few months, including sequencing time. Our approach uses genome contiguity information as derived from proximity ligation of in vitro assembled chromatin. It harnesses the speed and cost-effectiveness of high-throughput sequencing to generate large amounts of haplotype-phased contiguity data spanning well over 100 kilobases in length. Using this approach we will generate de novo assembled genomes from 50 humans and 12 non-human primates of high accuracy, partially haplotype phased, with scaffold N50s expected to be between 10 and 20 Mb in length.",Cell and Tissue Culture,-35.91091245737188

11,None,9539540,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease worldwide, with a prevalence of more than 1% in the population over the age of 60, thus constituting a major global health problem of the aging population. The disease is primarily characterized by a major loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons but the genetic etiology leading to the neuronal cell loss has largely remained unknown. Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that point to more than 50 genomic loci containing risk variants for sporadic PD. However the identified risk variants predominantly map to poorly understood non-coding regions of the genome, which has impeded functional and molecular understanding of how these genetic variants contribute to the increased risk for PD. Importantly, it has been established that PD GWAS associated loci are typically non-coding and mediate allele-specific effects on distal gene expression, consistent with a central role for disruption on enhancer element function in PD pathogenesis  Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology offers for the first time the unique opportunity to study sporadic diseases whose genetic components are poorly understood, by allowing for the generation of human patient-derived somatic cells such as midbrain dopaminergic neurons which carry all the genetic alterations that contributed to the development of the disease. The overall goal of this project is to establish a transformational paradigm, which overcomes the substantial technical limitations of the iPS system and creates a genetically defined experimental in vitro system for studying the molecular and biological mechanisms of sporadic PD in the dish.  To achieve this, we will establish a novel experimental framework to link descriptive GWAS PD hits to genomic regulatory enhancer elements and establish functional assays for connecting PD risk alleles to the expression of disease relevant effector genes. Our aim is to gain molecular understanding of the complex interactions between multiple genetic risk alleles and to identify key genes of which the expression level affects the PD specific cellular phenotype. To identify functional relevant candidate risk variants (PD-eQLTs) we will link PD associated risk alleles to genomic regulatory (enhancer) elements that are relevant for gene activity in neurons by establishing an enhancer map in cultured homogenous dopaminergic neurons as well as in sorted neuronal nuclei from human brain. Insights into these interactions will facilitate devising rational therapeutic strategies. This experimental in vitro platform will be used to define the interactions of environmental risk factors with the genetic determinants that have been predicted from GWA studies to predispose to PD (GxE).",Cell and Tissue Culture,-49.38912809563911

Using a radically innovative and simple approach, we can now generate highly contiguous de novo assemblies of human and non-human primate genomes. The approach requires sub- microgram quantities of DNA and can be carried done from start to finish within a few months, including sequencing time. Our approach uses genome contiguity information as derived from proximity ligation of in vitro assembled chromatin. It harnesses the speed and cost-effectiveness of high-throughput sequencing to generate large amounts of haplotype-phased contiguity data spanning well over 100 kilobases in length. Using this approach we will generate de novo assembled genomes from 50 humans and 12 non-human primates of high accuracy, partially haplotype phased, with scaffold N50s expected to be between 10 and 20 Mb in length.",3D Cell-Based Assays,-202.6484209959585
9,None,9539540,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease worldwide, with a prevalence of more than 1% in the population over the age of 60, thus constituting a major global health problem of the aging population. The disease is primarily characterized by a major loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons but the genetic etiology leading to the neuronal cell loss has largely remained unknown. Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that point to more than 50 genomic loci containing risk variants for sporadic PD. However the identified risk variants predominantly map to poorly understood non-coding regions of the genome, which has impeded functional and molecular understanding of how these genetic variants contribute to the increased risk for PD. Importantly, it has been established that PD GWAS associated loci are typically non-coding and mediate allele-specific effects on distal gene expression, consistent with a central role for disruption on enhancer element function in PD pathogenesis  Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology offers for the first time the unique opportunity to study sporadic diseases whose genetic components are poorly understood, by allowing for the generation of human patient-derived somatic cells such as midbrain dopaminergic neurons which carry all the genetic alterations that contributed to the development of the disease. The overall goal of this project is to establish a transformational paradigm, which overcomes the substantial technical limitations of the iPS system and creates a genetically defined experimental in vitro system for studying the molecular and biological mechanisms of sporadic PD in the dish.  To achieve this, we will establish a novel experimental framework to link descriptive GWAS PD hits to genomic regulatory enhancer elements and establish functional assays for connecting PD risk alleles to the expression of disease relevant effector genes. Our aim is to gain molecular understanding of the complex interactions between multiple genetic risk alleles and to identify key genes of which the expression level affects the PD specific cellular phenotype. To identify functional relevant candidate risk variants (PD-eQLTs) we will link PD associated risk alleles to genomic regulatory (enhancer) elements that are relevant for gene activity in neurons by establishing an enhancer map in cultured homogenous dopaminergic neurons as well as in sorted neuronal nuclei from human brain. Insights into these interactions will facilitate devising rational therapeutic strategies. This experimental in vitro platform will be used to define the interactions of environmental risk factors with the genetic determinants that have been predicted from GWA studies to predispose to PD (GxE).",3D Cell-Based Assays,-303.7174204417904
